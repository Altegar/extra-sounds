## [3.0.0] - ????-??-??

### Changed

* Rewrite in Kotlin (new Fabric Kotlin dependency)
* If sounds are unsupported for any given version, most will no longer crash the game and just be ignored

### Fixed

* Incompatibility with some servers - sounds are no longer registered, this was unnecessary from the start
